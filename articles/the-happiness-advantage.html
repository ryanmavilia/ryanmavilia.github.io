                            # Thoughts on The Happiness Advantage by Shawn Achor
                            ## Introduction
                            I just finished reading The Happiness Advantage by Shawn Achor who is a corporate speaker
                            and researcher
                            on happiness. I had low expectations going into the book, but it surprised me with some new
                            actionable
                            ideas to apply to my own life. The thing I enjoyed most were all the little anecdotes
                            showcasing how
                            simple things can lead to people feeling happier. The stories gave me a lot of inspiration
                            and led to a
                            lot of thoughts of "maybe things aren't so bad" trickling into my mind.

                            As I write this article and do more research on it, I've found that there are some
                            criticisms of his work
                            from other happiness researchers. Overall it seems like most of the claims are valid, but
                            it's important
                            to view this book as more of a toolbox. If you see something you agree with, then go ahead
                            and use it. For
                            tools that don't fit your life, work on being open to using them in the future but don't try
                            to force them
                            in. That thinking is how I've progressed myself the most in my personal, professional, and
                            social life.
                            When I learn a principle that resonates with me I apply it immediately, but when one doesn't
                            I still think
                            about it and try to adapt it to work for myself.

                            ## Seven principles summary

                            >Happiness is not the belief that we don't need to change it is the realization that we can.
                            ### Principle 1: The Happiness Advantage
                            - Positive brains work better so you should retrain your brain to capitalize on positivity.
                            - Those who are happiest perform the best in different areas of their lives.
                            - Those who are surrounded by others who are happier tend to be happier too. Those managed
                            by happy bosses
                            are more likely to look forward to work and do better at their jobs.
                            - The simple presence of people or things that make us unhappy can have large negative
                            impacts on our work
                            - When people are primed with positive thinking they tend to do better.
                            - Practice acts of kindness especially for others.
                            - Buying things for others can help a lot compared to buying things for ourselves.
                            - When buying things invest in experiences rather than just physical objects.
                            - Exercise to help release endorphins and boost mood.
                            - Focus on the present.
                            - Plan things for yourself to look forward to.
                            - Cut out negative things from your life such as the news. Work on journaling about the
                            positives from
                            your day. Don't focus on the negatives.
                            - Remind yourself of your talents and practice them.
                            - Sometimes happiness can be a choice and a practice rather than just an ephemeral emotional
                            state.
                            - Happiness fuels success.

                            ### Principle 2: Fulcrum and Lever
                            - Adjust our mindset (fulcrum) in a way that gives us the power (lever) to be more fulfilled
                            and
                            successful.
                            - Growth mindset vs. fixed mindset. Growth mindset believes they can change their traits.
                            When you have a
                            growth mindset you seek out new things. You're more resilient to change. You are more likely
                            to find
                            opportunities. Fixed mindset
                            - Pygmalion effect: higher expectations lead to improved performance.
                            - Our view of the world and interpretation of it is what creates our reality which means we
                            can change
                            that perspective at will.
                            - When you have expectations of certain outcomes and use those expectations to fuel your
                            actions you are
                            more likely to achieve those expectations than if you were to do the same actions with no
                            expectations.

                            ### Principle 3: The Tetris Effect
                            - When we do something on repeat we get good at it and subconsciously apply it to other
                            parts of our
                            lives. For example if you spend all day reviewing code looking for bugs you may come home
                            and unknowingly
                            look for issues when you interact with your significant other.
                            - We also are good at filtering out things that we view as spam. Focusing on a task
                            exacerbates this
                            skill.
                            - Train your brain to focus on the positives and it will naturally filter out the negatives.
                            - Studies showed that those who thought they were unlucky missed opportunities that were
                            seen by those who
                            thought they were lucky.
                            - Personal take: this may explain why the idea of the "law of attraction" actually works.
                            Those who are
                            looking for what they want are more likely to see opportunities to get it. Those
                            opportunities would be
                            available to them regardless, but they only notice them when they are in a headspace to look
                            for them.
                            - One exercise to practice this is to journal three good things from your day every day.
                            This will help
                            train your mind to look for positive things.

                            ### Principle 4: Falling Up
                            - When we view failure as growth we are more likely to experience growth.
                            - There is a path that leads to post-traumatic growth when facing great adversity. This is
                            the third path,
                            which differs from going down a negative path (spiraling down) or staying on the same path
                            and never
                            growing.
                            - When people feel helplessness in one area of life they often overlearn and apply the
                            lesson to other
                            parts of their life. This is what leads to learned helplessness.
                            - Those with an optimistic explanatory style (way of explaining things) interpret adversity
                            as temporary
                            and local. Those who have pessimistic explanatory style interpret adversity as global and
                            permanent.
                            - Turn your adversity into an advantage and think about how you can learn from it. Be
                            resilient and you
                            will be able to face greater challenges.

                            ### Principle 5: The Zorro Circle
                            - Limiting your focus to small manageable goals can help expand your sphere of power.
                            - Successful people have an internal locus of control. They believe their actions have a
                            direct effect on
                            their outcomes. Unsuccessful people tend to have an external locus of control and think that
                            events in
                            their lives are dictated by external forces. They duck blame for failure and they don't take
                            credit for
                            the successes.
                            - Writing feelings or verbalizing them is the first step to regaining control.
                            - Set goals that are not so easy that you don't want to try but not so hard that you give
                            up.
                            - Kaizen is a Japanese word for continuous improvement. Strive to make tiny, incremental
                            changes.
                            - Set a time limit, do the one thing, keep it fixed and then expand it.

                            ### Principle 6: The 20 Second Rule
                            - Common sense is not common action. Just because something seems like an obvious choice
                            doesn't mean we
                            are going to do it. We know eating an entire bag of chips is not as good for us as eating a
                            salad but yet
                            we choose the chips anyway.
                            - Remove the energy needed to do things.
                            - Make good things easy to access and bad things hard to access. If you struggle with
                            getting sucked into
                            TV shows then put the remote on the other side of the house. If you have issues getting your
                            writing done,
                            then put your journal next to the place you eat breakfast. Get creative!
                            - Reduce the choices you have and set rules for yourself. The more options we have the more
                            we face
                            decision fatigue which makes it harder to do the right things.

                            ### Principle 7: The Social Investment
                            - Successful people hold onto social circles tightly rather than turning inward during hard
                            times.
                            - High emotional support is our offensive line that allows us to keep focused on our goals.
                            - The strength of social relationships is directly correlated to one's happiness.
                            - The quality of your relationships is more important than the quantity.
                            - Friends, family, and community give a sense of purpose, belonging, and security which is
                            extremely
                            helpful in finding happiness.

                            ## My Takeaways

                            ### Using the Tetris effect
                            I think the Tetris effect was the principle I most connected with. It was a great study of
                            something that
                            many less scientific philosophies teach about. There's mood boards, the law of attraction,
                            and goal
                            affirmations. These all seem like nonsense to a more analytical mind but this principle
                            shows why these
                            may have merit.

                            Just in my day-to-day life I've started to notice how on my good days I tend to encounter
                            more positive
                            life events. The events can be small like finding a dollar on the ground or even bigger like
                            noticing
                            performance optimizations I could make in the code I'm writing.

                            ### We have control
                            I battled a lot of depression throughout my life but as the years go on and I reflect more I
                            continually
                            notice just how much power we have over our emotions. This isn't to be misconstrued as "just
                            be happy"
                            style advice if going through seriously dark times. However, for a simple bad day I think it
                            can be
                            helpful to realize that you have the ability to change. It's easy to sink into a feeling of
                            helplessness
                            but with tiny changes you can break out.

                            The important thing is to work on finding those things. I could probably write an entire
                            article on the
                            coping mechanisms I've found for myself. Work on building up your tool set and practice
                            using them. With
                            practice you will realize that you have more control than you once thought.

                            These tools are present in all the principles. From thinking positive for the Tetris effect
                            to giving
                            yourself easy-to do mood-boosting activities for the 20 second rule and the Zorro circle.
                            There's lots of
                            ways to interweave the principles to create the framework you need for your life.

                            ### No harm in trying
                            To me the teachings of this book seem to line up with anecdotal ideas and findings I've
                            already had. I
                            think most people would probably think the same. While reading there are a lot of thoughts
                            similar to, "Of
                            course people who like their manager work better" or "Well, duh, if you have friends and
                            exercise you are
                            going to be happier". This book neatly ties those obvious things into memorable principles.
                            The hard thing
                            is remembering to apply them but the easy thing is realizing that you can.

                            I always enjoy these types of books because for the most part there is no harm in trying out
                            their
                            techniques. Whether you decide to go do 5 minutes of exercise or you give a call to a loved
                            one I implore
                            you to go try something from this article out. See how you feel. Think about what you could
                            use and apply
                            it to your life. You may just end up a bit happier.
