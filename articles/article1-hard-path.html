                                <p>
                                    When you think about your future or even the
                                    universe's future you realize something. At
                                    the end of the day, it all ends. Nothing is
                                    permanent and it will all come to a close in
                                    one way or another. That's why the idea of
                                    legacy projects always seemed odd to me. Now
                                    that doesn't include the idea of heaven
                                    which I guess would be a good rebuttal but
                                    with regards to what we know we are all
                                    gonna meet our end one day.
                                </p>
                                <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl">
                                    Does this matter at all?
                                </h2>
                                <p>
                                    When thinking about this it's easy to get
                                    sunk into an idea of "why try if nothing
                                    matters?". The funny thing is that the
                                    statement is not wrong. Nothing matters.
                                    There is no point in trying. But the more
                                    complete idea would be: Nothing matters.
                                    There is no point in trying if you only care
                                    about things that last forever. However as
                                    humans we are biologically hardwired to not
                                    care about things lasting forever. We
                                    constantly seek out ways to achieve
                                    temporary happiness, contentment, and peace.
                                    It's the reason we seek to make extravagant
                                    meals instead of just eating rice and beans
                                    everyday. The same reason why we take a hot
                                    shower rather than a lukewarm one. We play
                                    music rather than sitting in silence. We are
                                    always looking to improve our current
                                    situation with something that brings us more
                                    joy.
                                </p>
                                <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl">
                                    Why do we make bad decisions?
                                </h2>
                                <p>
                                    Then is it that we find it so easy to fall
                                    into depression and anxiety which stops us
                                    from seeking this joy in the more abstract
                                    parts of our lives? Unlike choosing a shower
                                    setting or choosing scallop risotto over
                                    Soylent the choice to push on and make macro
                                    decisions that bring joy to us is a harder
                                    decision. It's not a simple task. It takes
                                    sustained effort to get to the goal. When
                                    there's an unclear goal and a set of
                                    obstacles in the way of it we won't
                                    automatically make thee choice. We will stop
                                    and think. We will feel the effort we are
                                    putting in and wonder if it is worth it. We
                                    will notice that we are experiencing pain
                                    that is not being displaced by joy.

                                    Enjoy the process
                                </h2>
                                <p>
                                    That's why so many people talk about
                                    enjoying the process. Whether or not we can
                                    do that is probably up to psychologists but
                                    I choose to believe that we can. I've seen
                                    many times before how my brain can be
                                    rewired by simple choices. It may seem odd
                                    but it works. You just need to be willing to
                                    stop and rethink the automatic decision that
                                    your brain made. Maybe you stopped and
                                    thought this isn't worth it. Now you need to
                                    choose the opposite. Stop and tell yourself
                                    "this is worth it". Remind yourself "I enjoy
                                    putting in this work".
                                </p>

                                </h2>
                                <p>
                                    Be careful to strike a balance with this. If
                                    you fall in love with work so much you may
                                    never stop to enjoy the results that your
                                    work brings you. But maybe that's okay too.
                                    If it brings you joy then are you not
                                    enjoying it just because you aren't spending
                                    time relaxing in your success?
