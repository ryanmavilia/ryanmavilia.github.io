                            # Mountains to Molehills
                            When starting a new project, it's important to be realistic about the challenges involved.
                            I'm working on
                            an app that allows users to create collaborative SoundCloud playlists. It was awesome to get
                            the first API
                            call to work to just update a playlist with whatever songs I provided. I was so ready to
                            build more
                            because this feeling was awesome.But then I looked up and saw the mountain in front of me.

                            ## The mountains

                            I needed to have user accounts, passwords, and a better API connection. The typical advice
                            is to start
                            small which would be great but it comes with its own issues. If I don't think about users
                            now how am I
                            gonna add users to existing playlists later? Do I support both? Do I even need to have users
                            in the end?

                            It's like laying down a railroad track. You have to lay down your track in front of you but
                            then you look
                            up and realize how far you have to go. You try to start small but if you never look up you
                            may end up
                            steering your track off course. How do we build towards the destination we want without
                            feeling like our
                            journey will never end?

                            ## Working towards a solution

                            Things get overwhelming very quickly. You start to face a dilemma: **build everything
                            upfront or
                            prioritize core functionality?** This embodies the balance between "future-proofing" and
                            efficient
                            development.

                            Future needs are important, but building a complex system from scratch hinders progress.
                            Prioritize your
                            core functionality but as you do so make sure to factor in what design decisions you're
                            making that could
                            create issues in the future. When you identify those things consider compromises you can
                            make to mitigate
                            them without doing all the work upfront.
                            ### Real life example

                            This applies not only to software development but to your life as well. Take renovating a
                            house for
                            example. Tearing down walls feels liberating, but skipping the plan for future electrical
                            outlets,
                            plumbing, and desired features hidden behind them can lead to a nightmare of rerouted wires,
                            damaged
                            structures, and missed opportunities for recessed lighting or hidden storage. By tackling
                            the seemingly
                            small task of planning upfront, you avoid the much larger challenges and expenses of rework
                            later â€“ a
                            classic example of the "mountains to molehills" approach in action.

                            ### Exemplifying compromise

                            Data modeling presents another challenge. Newer developers often struggle with building for
                            now versus the
                            future. Building an MVP requires a quicker approach, but later data model changes can be
                            disruptive.

                            For example, if playlists aren't currently tied to users, what happens to "public" playlists
                            when user
                            accounts are added? Think through these potential changes. Do you need to backfill data, and
                            if so, do you
                            have the information needed?

                            In this case, I wouldn't. However, I do need to tie playlists to users somehow. One option
                            could be adding
                            simple "passwords" without initial users. Then, when I implement users, I could give people
                            the ability to
                            transfer their playlists to accounts using those passwords.

                            ## Staying on the right path

                            We must acknowledge the bigger picture while focusing on the immediate task. For my app,
                            this means
                            breaking the project down into smaller milestones. Instead of getting overwhelmed by the
                            entire
                            development process, I can focus on completing a functional prototype for a single user.
                            Once complete, I
                            can celebrate that accomplishment and re-evaluate the path ahead. User feedback might
                            identify new
                            features that require a course correction but I can't predict everything and I certainly
                            can't build the
                            "perfect" app if I haven't even built the imperfect one first.

                            This iterative approach mirrors the railroad track analogy. We lay down manageable sections
                            of track,
                            assess the landscape, and adjust our approach as needed. This continuous cycle allows us to
                            make steady
                            progress without succumbing to the illusion of insurmountable mountains.

                            ## The Agile approach

                            Starting simple is always great advice but for more complex things it doesn't always hold
                            true. You have
                            to learn how to break down your grand vision into smaller projects which can be changed out
                            as needed.
                            Once you have those you can break the projects into tasks which can also be modified to your
                            liking. This
                            Agile approach is a great starting point. The important thing to remember is the long game.
                            Cal Newport, a
                            productivity expert, recommends focusing on long-term goals and taking consistent action.
                            Find the
                            methodologies that enable you to produce your best work in the long run.

                            This app I've been building could become something really amazing not just for myself but
                            for other
                            SoundCloud users as well. My vision excites me but the work required is daunting. Instead of
                            staring at
                            the mountain of tasks, I find it more productive to focus on the immediate path. I put in a
                            few hours of
                            focused work. Then when I take a step back I'm often surprised by how much progress I've
                            made. The journey
                            unfolds in unexpected ways. Sometimes you realize you're closer to the peak than you
                            thought. You may even
                            stop to look up and realize there's an even faster route to take. That's the beauty of the
                            development
                            process. There's always room for adaptation. You just have to keep walking and find the pace
                            that works
                            best for you.

                            At least that's how the journey looks in my head. We'll see how far I make it by the end of
                            this month!
