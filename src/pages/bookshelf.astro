            This bookshelf visualization was created as a reusable Astro component.
            Each book's color and height are generated consistently from its title,
            so the same book always looks the same.
          </p>
          <p>
            The bookshelf automatically arranges books across multiple shelves as needed.
            Hover over any book to see its title, author, description, and optional review or summary.
          </p>
