This is the first post in a new series where I write based on a random prompt. This week's prompt is write about the last photo you took.

This is not meant to be an exercise of writing skills but rather one of discipline. Trying to get back into the habit of having constraints and requirements to add friction that allow me to continue creating and ignore the flood of noise.

## Raw Beef

Got a raw beef dish from [My Canh](http://mycanhpho.com/) and while I wish this photo was better the beef was certainly delicious.

Still not as good as Phnom Penh Restaurant in Vancouver though..

I'm doing a small pit stop in the Bay Area. After living in San Diego for a while I've finally built a solid amount of friends who are originally from the bay. Some have moved back and I make trips to see them whenever I can.

## Mac OS Photo Conversion with Exif Strip

This taught me of a tool as I was trying to figure out how to strip the exif data from the original HEIC picture my iPhone took.

> Right click the photo, hover Quick Actions, click Convert Image, and untick Preserve Metadata.

That's good to know and based on one EXIF checker it worked.

## That's it

This was an interesting exercise and I could see how it could be more fun with a prompt I'm more interested in. Until next time.
